To generate architectrues represented by formula F1(N,M) or F2(N,M), the code lenght N should be larger than 4, and the parallism M should be larger than 2 and smaller than N. Both N and M should be powers of 2.

To generate architectrues represented by formula F2(N,H), the code lenght N should be larger than 4, and the number of stages should range between 1 and log2(N). N should be a power of 2.
